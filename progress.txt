## Iteration 1 - Project Setup (Vite + React + Tailwind + PWA)
- Initialized npm project with React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, vite-plugin-pwa
- Created project structure: src/components, src/hooks, src/data, public/assets/watercolors, public/icons
- Set up index.html with viewport meta, Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display), theme-color
- Created src/index.css with Tailwind v4 import and all CSS variables from brand guidelines
- Created src/main.jsx and src/App.jsx with basic rendering
- Copied watercolor images to public/assets/watercolors/
- Created .gitignore
- Files changed: package.json, vite.config.js, index.html, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/index.css, .gitignore
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The project path contains an apostrophe ("Mama's Birthday") which breaks workbox service worker generation. vite-plugin-pwa is installed but disabled in vite.config.js. Re-enable when deploying from a clean CI path.
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of the old `@tailwind` directives
  - Using `type: "module"` in package.json for ESM
  - Build verified working with `npx vite build`

## Iteration 2 - Tile Rendering
- Created src/data/tiles.js with all 144 tile definitions (Dots/Bams/Craks x9x4, Winds x4x4, Dragons x3x4, Flowers x4, Seasons x4)
- Includes tile labels, suit labels (Chinese characters), color mappings per suit, flower/season image mappings
- Includes tilesMatch() function with special flower/season matching rules
- Includes generateTileSet() that produces exactly 144 tiles
- Created src/components/Tile.jsx - renders individual tile with:
  - Watercolor background tint per suit (Dots=blue, Bams=green, Craks=pink, etc.)
  - Full watercolor painting background (30% opacity) for flower and season tiles
  - High-contrast symbol + suit label overlay
  - Selected state (lifted, lavender border, enhanced shadow)
  - Blocked/free state (dimmed, desaturated when blocked)
  - Accessible button element with aria-label
- Updated App.jsx to render a preview grid of all unique tile types
- Files changed: src/data/tiles.js (new), src/components/Tile.jsx (new), src/App.jsx (updated), PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Watercolor images available: tiles_1.png through tiles_8.png, tiles_4.jpg/5.jpg/7.jpg are JPG, rest PNG
  - bg-texture.png available for board background texture
  - Tile component uses inline styles for dynamic coloring (suit-specific) + Tailwind for layout
  - generateTileSet() returns tiles with {id, suit, value, copy} - positions added later by layout
  - Build verified with `npx vite build` - passes clean
