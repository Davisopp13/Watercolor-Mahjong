# Watercolor Mahjong — Progress Log

## Previous Sprint Summary
Ralph completed two full PRD sprints overnight:
- Sprint 1: 5-layer Turtle layout, stuck detection, win celebration with birthday message, hint/undo/shuffle, progress indicator, match animations, birthday dedication screen, mobile responsiveness
- Sprint 2: Tile redesign (paintings replacing symbols with variant number badges), audio implementation (mute toggle, background music, sound effects)

## Known Issues Going Into This Sprint
- PWA icon has harsh white background — needs warm cream (#FDF8F0) to match game aesthetic
- Mobile viewport: board scales too small to fit screen — tiles are ~25-30px and untappable. Need zoomed-in scrollable view instead.
- Playable vs blocked tiles: visual contrast is insufficient — hard to tell which tiles are interactive at a glance
- Audio uses Web Audio API synthesized oscillator tones that sound like buzzing — need real mp3 files instead

## Learnings From Previous Sprints
- Tile component structure: button.tile with child divs for overlay, watercolor background, gradient, and content
- Blocked state: applied via `blocked` CSS class on the button element
- Tailwind CSS is the styling framework — use utility classes
- PWA viewport meta already set: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`
- Theme color: #9B8BB8 (purple)
- Board uses absolute positioning for tiles
- 9 watercolor painting assets mapped to tile suits, 4 variants each, 4 copies = 144 tiles
- Audio system exists with mute toggle and localStorage persistence — needs mp3 file swap, not a rewrite
- Icon assets are in the public directory — check for existing generation scripts or source files
- The game's cream/off-white background color is approximately #FDF8F0

## Iteration 1 - PWA Icon — Warm Cream Background
- Generated new icon files with cream (#FDF8F0) background using Python/Pillow
- Created: icon-192.png (192x192), icon-512.png (512x512), apple-touch-icon.png (180x180), favicon.ico (32x32)
- Source: logo_tile_icon.png (500x500) composited onto cream background, converted to RGB (no alpha)
- Updated vite.config.js manifest icons to reference properly-sized icon files instead of logo_tile_icon.png
- Updated index.html with favicon.ico, sized icon links, and apple-touch-icon reference
- Manifest background_color was already #FDF8F0, theme_color stays #9B8BB8 (purple for status bar)
- Files changed: public/icons/icon-192.png, public/icons/icon-512.png, public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png, public/favicon.ico, vite.config.js, index.html, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Vite copies public/ contents to dist/ at root level — favicon.ico goes in public/ not public/icons/
  - No test/typecheck scripts — `npm run build` is the only verification
  - logo_tile_icon.png is a hydrangea tile with transparency around rounded rect shape — the cream fill eliminates white gaps
  - icon-192.png and icon-512.png were previously different artwork (lilac) — now they match the primary logo_tile_icon
