## Iteration 1 - Project Setup (Vite + React + Tailwind + PWA)
- Initialized npm project with React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, vite-plugin-pwa
- Created project structure: src/components, src/hooks, src/data, public/assets/watercolors, public/icons
- Set up index.html with viewport meta, Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display), theme-color
- Created src/index.css with Tailwind v4 import and all CSS variables from brand guidelines
- Created src/main.jsx and src/App.jsx with basic rendering
- Copied watercolor images to public/assets/watercolors/
- Created .gitignore
- Files changed: package.json, vite.config.js, index.html, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/index.css, .gitignore
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The project path contains an apostrophe ("Mama's Birthday") which breaks workbox service worker generation. vite-plugin-pwa is installed but disabled in vite.config.js. Re-enable when deploying from a clean CI path.
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of the old `@tailwind` directives
  - Using `type: "module"` in package.json for ESM
  - Build verified working with `npx vite build`
